  - Don't put to much in storage.
 - Update your address.
  - Insurance
  - Banking
  - Subscriptions
  - ID Card
 - Do a trial trip.
 - Capsule Wardrobe
 - Decide on the smallest amount of toiletries to keep you happy.
 - Limit your packing list.
 - Purchase a good car.
 - Book your first month of stays(AirBNB)
 - Turn off power to apartment
 - Give up our apartment lease
