##### 1) Chunk Your App Into Pieces

 - Turn everything into a MICROservice.

##### 2) Modernize Access To Data

 - Implement Data Access via API's or using a similar data store.

 - Developers should not care what it looks like on the backend. They should be
  able to easly access and manipulate the data in a secure way using their
   favorite languages.

##### 3) Replace Decaying Code

 - Slowly replace chunks of your application one piece at a time.

#### Benifits:

 - Consolidation of Virtual Machines.

 - Easier to move services around.

 - Scaling services is easy.

 - Chatops

 - Use Open Source Technology

 - Changes Culture as getting stuff done is very rewarding.
