As a developer, kubernetes acts as an abstraction between you and the hardware. Simply write your applications and built them into containers.

What K8 accomplishes:

Scheduling - Figure out where our containers should run.
Storage - Where the heck do I store persistent information?
Fault Tolerance - Keep your containers running.
Service Discovery - How you talk between containers.
Load Balancing - Round Robin your traffic amongst replica containers.
Scaling - Increase/Decrease the side of your containers.
Logging - Figure out when, where, and how things went wrong.
Authorization - Control who can do what when.
