This isn't nessesarly a good representation of the best python tools or packages, but the top I have used over the past year.

[pyorc](https://github.com/jflesch/pyocr) - An amazing package that wraps around Tesseract so that you can do optical character recognition on imag

[tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox) - A wonderful package that you can use to automate and standardize python testing.

[psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) - Cross platform library that exposes process and system information.

[gmvault](https://github.com/gaubert/gmvault) - Not a library, but still written in python. It gives me the ability to backup and restore my emails from gmail, locally.

[elasticsearch-dsl-py](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) - Favorite high level library for elasticsearch manipulation.

[2to3](https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html) - Great tool for helping move from a python 2 codebase to a python 3 codebase.

[httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie) - A good tool for sending HTTP requests without the complexity that is CURL.

[yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) - Code formatting tool made by google. Very useful in a team enviroment to ensure all code looks as if it was written by a single developer.
