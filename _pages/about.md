I am passionate about building easy-to-use and reliable web applications. On the daily, I am involved in requirement gathering, architecture design, implementation, and deploying applications to highly available and scalable systems.

If I am not working on some sort of side project then you can find me longboarding, building/flying quadcopters, or learning about animals.

Skills: Microservices, gRPC, Python, Envoy Proxy, AWS, Elasticsearch, HAProxy, Nginx, Docker, Kubernetes, Design Patterns, Testing, and REST APIs.
Frameworks: Django, Flask, Elasticsearch DSL, React, Redux, Mobx, Vue.JS, and Express
