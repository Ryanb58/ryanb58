        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Taylor. Just another Software Engineer and Entrepreneur floating around in this world.</p>
<p>Day to day, I carry around a tiny orange notebook where I write down loads of ideas. From products, to shower thoughts; I am always trying to push my creative thinking.</p>
<p>You can call me curious, as I tend to ask a ton of questions. Doing so usually leads me down rabbitholes on Youtube, and readdit. Most of the time, focused on a topic that is totally unrelated articles to my life. For example: I do not need to do any actual home maintance because I live in an apartment, however, if you asked me to replace a sink, put up a LED strip, or attach a bidet to a toliet. I would absolutly be able to get it done.</p>
<p>A problem I've been struggling with on my own is <code>idea execution</code>. Building things is easy at work. Surrounded by my peers, bouncing ideas off one another, discussing the next steps and business requirements. Simple. However, when I start to working  on my own ideas at home I tend to fade. Thus, I am trying to build more things publicily to hold myself accountable.</p>
