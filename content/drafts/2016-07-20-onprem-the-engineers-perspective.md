So you want to build an on-prem. Great! On-prems are cash rich enviroments that
allow for sales into the entrerprise marketspace without much effort. Right?

Well, from your engineers perspectives, no. Sadly on-prems add a lot of
complexity that originally was avoided because of the "cloud". Let's dive into a
few of these complexities in which your engineers will face.

### Physical Limits

### Software Updates

### Non-Reproduceable Bugs
Can only be reproduced on the on-prem

### Security

### Billing

### Support

### Update System/Policy

### Guessing At What Your User Is Doing

### Logging

### Scaling

### Uptime/Avalability

### Lack of Features in the mean time.

### Tranfering of accounts between onprems and cloud. 
Clashing of usernames or user spaces.

### Virtual Deploys

### Automating Everything

### Protecting your IP/code.
On-Prems are inherritently a security risk for your company, especially if you 
are using an interprated language. On-prems can easily be torn apart and your
application copied/cloned.
